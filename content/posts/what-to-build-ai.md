**Abstract** 
This document focuses on the changing landscape of AI business creation, consumption, cost optimization, innovation in entrepreneurs' businesses with an emphasis upon consumer-based solutions using人工智能 (AI) technologies for food supply, water and waste management etc., thereby creating a new economy model that fosters sustainable living. The key takeaways include how technological advancements will significantly change the way we consume products while preserving value creation processes - both in terms of cost optimization at low costs as well as innovation through embracing solutions from all parts within consumers' capabilities and enabling businesses to operate optimally under current constraints.

**Introduction (1-2 paragraphs)** 
This section introduces AI, its impact on the world economy and how it is changing business models based upon consumer preference rather than fixed profit margins for both producers as well companies who aim at maximizing their returns while maintaining fairness in terms of cost efficiency. It also explains why consumers should create or consume better instead of competing with others (market share) which can lead to a fragmented marketplace and cause confusion, misunderstanding the value proposition they perceive from technology for business models that are not just about profit but rather sustainable living solutions through consumer-driven businesses using AI technologies.

**Technical Analysis 40%**  
This section includes detailed technical details related mainly on how we can lay out roads (technological infrastructure) to make the development process more manageable and streamlined, speeding up use cases solution or production processes if integrated with these technology developments - like AI models for autonomous vehicle routing systems. It also covers about cost optimization strategies such as minimizing IT costs while maintaining a high level of technological advancement which can reduce long-term maintenance issues by making the system more efficient and scalable over longer periods, hence increasing profitability in this context due to lower operational expenses compared with fixed prices or pre-purchased services.
 
**Implementation Considerations (20% - around halfway point)**  
This section discusses how these technological developments can be integrated within the current business landscape while maintaining competitiveness, minimizing risks and maximising returns for both parties involved in this process by considering all relevant factors like technology's ability to scale beyond consumer expectations with a high level of innovation. It also explains about security measures taken as part of implementing such technologies so that they don’t compromise the integrity or confidentiality within companies operating under these new models, thus reducing risk associated risks and maintaining fairness in terms of cost efficiency while maximizing returns for both parties involved during this process - including businesses owners who plan to build on top of them.
 
**Conclusion (50% - final paragraphs) **  
This section finally provides a summary viewpoint addressing the impact achieved, future prospects and its implications across industries like business automation through AI solutions that can lead towards sustainable living scenarios in terms of cost efficiency at lower costs than fixed prices or pre-purchased services. It also discusses how we should always consider all relevant factors while implementing such technologies to ensure competitive advantage over current consumers based businesses using these new models, thereby ensuring the smooth running and growth trajectory for both parties involved during this process - including entrepreneurship owners who want their business model not just about profit but rather sustainable living solutions.
